# **App Name**: AquaCheck HMPI

## Core Features:

- Data Import: Allow users to import groundwater heavy metal concentration datasets along with geo-coordinates from standard file formats.
- Automated HMPI Calculation: Automatically compute Heavy Metal Pollution Indices (HMPI) based on imported data, using predefined standard formulas.
- Groundwater Quality Categorization: Classify groundwater quality based on calculated HMPI values, providing clear, easy-to-understand quality categories.
- Interactive Mapping: Display groundwater quality data on an interactive map, visualizing pollution levels geographically. Use a generative AI tool to generate color scaled pollution maps based on HMPI data.
- Reporting & Export: Generate reports summarizing HMPI results, and enable data export to various formats.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light greenish-blue (#90EE90), evoking the purity of water while avoiding overused cliches; instead aiming for associations like nature and freshness.
- Background color: Very light greenish-blue (#F0FFF0), complementing the primary color while maintaining a clean and subtle backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale orange (#FFDAB9), to highlight important actions and information, creating contrast without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font with a modern yet approachable feel, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent data inputs, pollution levels, and report generation options.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout, with clear sections for data input, HMPI calculation results, map visualization, and report generation.
- Subtle transitions and animations when loading data or updating visualizations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
